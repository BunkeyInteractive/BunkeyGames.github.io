##Part One (Let me explain)##

"From 0 to Steam" is a new blog series that I'm starting on this site. The name is pretty self explainatory to anyone who knows anything about Gamedev. Simply put, my goal is to create a simple game, release it on Steam, and document the entire thing, right here.

So, without further delay, I present to you for your literary pleasures, Part 1 of this series.

###Let me explain...###

So I figured now would be a good time to explain a few things.

1. Why am I doing this?

2. What do I plan to accomplish by doing this?

3. What kind of game am I making?

Let's answer theese in order.

Firstly, I love Gamedev, and the Gamedev community. Good people, good times. I know personally that there are a lot of confusing things that go into making a game. I figured this series could help a lot of people along.

Secondly, what I plan to accomplish is simple. Develop a simple game, Publish it to steam, and Document the whole process. 

And Thirdly, I don't know exactly what kind of game I'm making, but I have a few guidlines I've laid out. 1. The game must be small in scope. 2. The game must have local or splitscreen co-op 3. The game must fit on Steam (Work well with Steamworks etc.) Othere than these 3 things, it's all up in the air.

I'm planning on releasing an update every few days or so. Life always get's in the way.
I also understand that the chance of this going smoothly all of the way through is very low. Infact, the chance of me finish this game AND getting it accepted to steam is very low. But, why not try?

I'll be back soon with update #2 where we will begin to discus some idea's for this new game!
